 A repository dedicated to exploring and implementing speech recognition techniques and applications using Python and the SpeechRecognition library. list of code files:

capture_voice_input.py: A function to capture voice input from the microphone.
convert_voice_to_text.py: A function to convert voice input to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
process_voice_command.py: A simple function to demonstrate processing voice commands.
main.py: The main file that runs the speech recognition application.
To run the application, follow these steps:

Install the SpeechRecognition library by running pip install SpeechRecognition.
Run the main.py file using a Python interpreter.
Speak into the microphone when prompted.
The application will convert your voice input to text and process the command.
This repository is a starting point for exploring speech recognition techniques and applications. You can expand the process_voice_command.py file to include more complex commands and actions. Additionally, you can explore other speech recognition APIs and techniques to improve the accuracy and functionality of the application.
